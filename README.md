## What
This is a browser extention that can open any link on any website in a new tab.
Especially websites that **developers** love to visit.

## Why

There are indeed existing extentions that can achieve the functionality of opening any link in a new tab.
However, they sometimes do not work properly. This is because these extentions only implement general functionalities without handling specific websites, causing some websites to still redirect to the same page. The unique feature of this plugin is that it provides special handling for websites favored by **developers**, including the following sites:

* [Medium](https://medium.com)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)   

Welcome to submit websites where the plugin does not work and requires special handling.
When I have free time, I will work on it.
